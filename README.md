# Flexible and Scalable Earthquake Forecasting
This repository includes the reference material for *Using deep-learning for flexible and scalable earthquake forecasting* by Kelian Dascher-Cousineau, Oleksandr Shchur, Emily Brodsky, and Stephan GÃ¼nnemann. Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) models provide an alternative approach to earthquake forecasting. Here, present an implementation of an NTPP, the Recurrent Earthquake foreCAST (RECAST).

The code includes:

1. Model definitions for both ETAS and the NTPP implementation: RECAST in the `eq` Python library 
2. Scripts for model training in the featured experiments in `experiments/`
3. Tutorials explaining how the code works: `notebooks/1. Training the model.ipynb`, `notebooks/2. Forecasting.ipynb`, and  `notebooks/3. (Experimental) training with extra features.ipynb`
3. Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce figures 2-4 in `notebooks/generate_figures/`
4. The trained models in `trained_models/`

## Reproducing the results
To reproduce the experimental results from the paper, please see the file `REPRODUCE.md`.

## Installation
The code has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) and MacOS.
1. Make sure you have the latest version of [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.
2. Install the dependencies and create a new conda environment.
    ```bash
    cd earthquake-ntpp
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate eq
    ```
   If you don't have a GPU on your machine, remove the line 
    ```
      - cudatoolkit=11.3
    ```
    from the file `environment.yml` before executing the commands above.
3. Install the `eq` package.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```


## Examples
### Training the model
A simple example of training an NTPP model via maximum likelihood.
```python
import eq
import pytorch_lightning as pl

# Load the earthquake catalog from (White et al. 2020)
catalog = eq.catalogs.White()

# Create train, validation and test dataloaders
dl_train = catalog.train.get_dataloader()
dl_val = catalog.val.get_dataloader()
dl_test = catalog.test.get_dataloader()

# Initialize and train the model
ntpp_model = eq.models.RecurrentTPP()
trainer = pl.Trainer(gpus=1, max_epochs=200)
trainer.fit(ntpp_model, dl_train)

# Compute negative log-likelihood on the test set
nll_test = trainer.test(ntpp_model, dl_test)
```

### Generating a forecast
Use a trained model to sample possible continuations of the catalog
```python
import eq

# Load the catalog
catalog = eq.catalogs.White()
test_seq = catalog.test[0]

# Generate 1000 forecasts over interval [4000, 4007] given events from [0, 4000]
t_forecast = 4000
duration = 7
num_samples = 1000
# Past events that we condition on
past_seq = test_seq.get_subsequence(0, t_forecast)
# Observed events in the 7-day forecast window
observed_seq = test_seq.get_subsequence(t_forecast, t_forecast + duration)

# Load a trained model from the checkpoint
model = eq.models.RecurrentTPP.load_from_checkpoint("trained_models/White_RecurrentTPP.ckpt")
model.eval()

# Sample 1000 trajectories over the 7-day window
forecast = model.sample(batch_size=num_samples, duration=duration, past_seq=past_seq, return_sequences=True)

# Visualize the forecast
eq.visualization.visualize_trajectories(test_seq, forecast)
```

## Available models
- `eq.models.ETAS`: The classic Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model.
- `eq.models.RecurrentTPP`: Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) model proposed in the paper.

## Available earthquake catalogs
The code includes the following earthquake catalogs for Southern California that we used in our experiments.
| Catalog name                                                                                         | Catalog start | Catalog end | # events | Magnitude of completness |

In addition, the following synthetic catalogs were used in the experiments
- `eq.catalogs.ETAS_SingleCatalog`: One long catalog produced by the ETAS model.
- `eq.catalogs.ETAS_MultiCatalog`: Multiple short catalogs produced by the ETAS model.
